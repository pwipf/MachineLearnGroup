# Machine Learning

This repository has java (netbeans) project which implements some machine learning algorithms and concepts.  
Some are more complete than others, some actually work!

Below are example visualization ouputs of various neural networks that we implemented, run on a breast cancer data file, breastcancer.arff.  The graph
shows the error on the y axis through time
or generation on the x axis.  This is intended to show convergence of the neural network training.  Having a low error does not
really give a true indication of the network's ability to generalize from the training data to test data, but it gives an idea what
is going on.

The arff file format is used with the [WEKA](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/) tool which we made use of for learning about machine learning.
